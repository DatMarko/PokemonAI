- I can create a tab for every pokemon. 
- For every tab, it'll have a table with a list of all the moves that pokemon can learn.
- To create each table, let's go through the pokemon_moves table and for each pokemon,
  only add one unique move into our new table. The pokemon_moves table repeats moves
  many many many times and i only want one of every move.
- Direction: use openpyxel to go through each pokemon and list each unique move in a list.
